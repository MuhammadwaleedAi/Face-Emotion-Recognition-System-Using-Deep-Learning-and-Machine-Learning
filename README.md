# Face-Emotion-Recognition-System-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Machine-Learning
A Face Emotion Recognition System uses deep learning and machine learning algorithms to detect and classify human emotions from facial expressions in images or video, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and fear.
Description

This project detects human emotions from facial expressions using Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
It captures video from a webcam, detects faces, and predicts emotions like happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, and neutral.
